# FinalProject

Statement:
In my pursuit of trying to exploit artificial intelligence, and trying to pin it as the bad guy I slowly started to realize that I was the one who was the bad guy in the situation. My initial idea was to work with Gemini Advanced ChatGPT, Midjourney, and Adobe Firefly. I intended to push their boundaries as the most ethical, Artificial Intelligence tools that I am currently aware of. Not only are they the most current and most ethically inclined tools at the moment they are also some of the most used generative tools as well. Looking at some research ChatGPT had the most users in 2023 bringing in about 14.6 billion users, and Bard at the moment was not too far off but only having about 241 million users. 
The purpose of my final project was to take a deep dive into these AI tools and see how far I could push them before, I either get blocked or I actually get it to obey my prompt. While I was under the impression that this was going to be easy if I just used the right words and maybe even sweet-talk the conversational Artificial Intelligence or just told them that it’s okay to be unethical sometimes. However, the road to pull unethical elements from the conversational AI’s was much harder than I thought. 
I started with researching what red, blue, and purple teaming was and what pen testing was as well. In this pursuit, I found out how impressive and interesting cyber security really is. While what I was attempting to do was nowhere near red teaming, it just finely walked the bounds of it.
